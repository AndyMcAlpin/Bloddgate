# Bloodgate: The Wildwood Deception 🗡️

Fight for an autonomous nation of elder dragons or defend the forest from an undead invasion? Or will you join forces with the demonic necromancers and wreak havoc from the Bloodgate. The choice is yours in the official first release of Bloodgate: The Wildwood Deception.

Highrealm has been almost completely overtaken by the demonic Bloodfury faction. The only place left unconquered is a broad stretch of land known as Wildwood. This magical place, protected by the Elder Wizard and his Legion of Forest creatures is the realm's only hope to return to its beautiful state.

After the dark elves of the neighboring Witchwood Cult made a deal with the Warlock's guild of Highrealm to make the nation of Dragons an independent state, the evil necromancers and dark wizards of Underrealm revealed the trickery of their plan. With the once-sealed portal holding back the dark forces for centuries now left unguarded, the evil dark priest summoned his deadly creatures into Highrealm. With the bloodgate now open, our heroes must defend this last stand or Highrealm may be destroyed, enslaving its creatures for all eternity.

## 📖 Developer Journey

📓 This is a long description about everything we want to say about creating this project. This should include process and challenges, as well as a thorough telling of technologies used and lessons learned along the way.

🦟 It should be multiple paragraphs long and should include a relevant emoji before each new paragraph. For example, this paragraph is about bugs.

## 🛠️ Installation
Locate the dropdown menu labeled 'Code' to the left of the About section in the main page of this repository. From there, select your preferred cloning method from HTTPS, SSH, or the GitHub CLI. For this demonstration, we will be using the SSH method. Copy the link and head to your terminal. From the command line you should enter:

    git clone <INSERT_SSH_KEY_HERE>

Replacing the above placeholder with the link copied from GitHub. This will clone the repository into a local directory on your machine. And that's it! Happy Hacking! 🚀

## 👨‍🏫 Usage
This code is strictly for use by the Bloodfury Dominion faction of demons and is only provided as material for study and otherwise double-checking implementation of various programming functionality. Any violations of these use cases will see the offender sent through the bloodgate, devoured by dragons, and eternally made fun of by the wood elves shortly thereafter. Screenshots of original mockup are included.
